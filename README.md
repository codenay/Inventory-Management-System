#About Inventory Management System 
---
This Inventory Management System project in C# and MySQL focuses mainly on keeping track of inventory activities. To be more precise, the system helps to keep track of inventories with respect to their sales. Also, the system displays all the paid, unpaid transactions of the items. In addition, the system allows managing system users and more. Evidently, this project contains an admin panel with a manager and customer panel. In an overview of this web application, an admin has full control over the system. He/she can manage employees, inventory items, and sales. Here, an admin can perform almost every work but still, the main role is to oversee the flow of the system.

##Manager Panel
Moreover, a manager’s account has access to manage the whole inventory activities. Here, a manager can add, update, remove and list out a company’s inventories. In fact, the system allows managing sales records. In order to manage inventories, the system requires details of inventories such as the name of the model, parts, type, price. Also, each and every item holds a stock quantity which is also managed by the manager or administrator. Furthermore, the system automatically deducts the quantity of a product as soon as the product passes through the transaction procedure. Besides, the manager can generate various reports in PDF format. It includes the report on item lists, orders, and more.

##Paid, UnPaid Orders
On one hand, the manager has access to maintain orders from the customers. In fact, the manager can list out a number of unpaid or pending orders. It includes the customer’s name with product details, pricing, and quantity. With it, the user has to take certain actions such as paid or unpaid status. Also, the user can cancel the order anytime. Additionally, the manager can simply mark the order as paid/unpaid in order to change the status. This is the exact point where the system automatically makes changes in the stock quantity. As mentioned earlier, the system also provides a variety of options for generating paid/unpaid order reports in PDF format. Regarding order reports, the user can have an overview of the customer’s name with product details, price, and status.

##Customer Panel
On the other hand, a user can simply register themselves in the system. Here, the system allows customers to search available products with their overall information. Additionally, a customer can look for their desired products and add products to the cart. And as soon as he/she finalizes cart products, the user can proceed to checkout. Also, the customer has to review the product before confirming the order. And as soon as the orders are confirmed, the records are transferred to the unpaid order section under the manager. With it, the customers can also view their overall orders and cancel orders if needed. To be more precise, the whole system for the customer side is much easy to use for filtering products and ordering purposes.
